# asteroids
game made with python test to learn more about OOP, NOT game development
   - one of the quotes on boot.dev course

# if (for some reason) you want to try it out
   - this used the venv interpreter, i activated my interpreter with source ~/.venvs/venv/bin/activate
   - you'd need to install venv with pip install venv
   - wsl extension for my vscode was installed too
   - and well python
   - if you get issues, i dont think i can help you with this, this was a small project for my dev courses
